Movie Search Engine Spec.

//TODO:
  - Add multithreading to dynamic programming in search engine
  - Add clear line / backspace / quit options with menu above search results
  - Maybe split movie titles containing multiple years into seperate entities
    -> perhaps make python script to do this + delete empty lines 
  - Add selection feature to pick a search result. cout wiki/imdb url to
      the selected movie.
